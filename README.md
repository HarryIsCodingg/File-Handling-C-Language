## File handling using C language and updating the user defined word to upper case letter in all the text files ##
* This application will take a single command argument. This argument will be interpreted as a text string. For example, if the program was called replace.exe, one
 might enter replace.exe apple.
 * In addition to opening and reading files, it will read the contents of the directory in order to see what files need to be checked. So the idea is to just loop through the file list, and open and examine each text file and replace the given word with upper case within those text files.
